## Question 12
## Description of problem: You should also see that the Kotla class has some extra lines in the method GetPointsForOccupancy. The child class can add extra attributes and methods, and can alter existing methods.

## This example which is already in the code, could be used to model another subclass. For example a "portal" which automatically moves any piece which goes onto it to a certain point. Or a "booster" square which increases the player's score. I'm not sure what the exam in the summer will ask you to do, but my money is on some kind of new class, based on the Kotla model.

## For now, try a "portal" class, which will be placed on square 42 for player 1 and 35 for player 2. Any of the player's own pieces which go to this square should magically move to the other player's mirza and win the game.
